# GEx Predictor

**GEx Predictor** is a tool for predicting gene expression based on chemical molecules represented as SMILES. It uses a trained neural network to generate predictions from **global molecular signatures** produced with `Signaturizer`.  

# Features

- Standardization of SMILES using RDKit.  
- Generation of global molecular signatures (GLOBAL Signature) with `Signaturizer`.  
- Gene expression prediction using a deep learning model (`GenomicExpressionNet2`).  
- Compatible with GPU and CPU via PyTorch.  

# GLOBAL Molecular Signature

This project uses the **GLOBAL molecular signature** generated by `Signaturizer`. This signature represents the chemical and bioactive properties of a molecule in a comprehensive way, as a 3,200-dimensional vector.

## Key details
- GLOBAL signatures combine multiple bioactivity spaces, capturing a complete representation of the molecule.  
- Each signature is a high-dimensional vector summarizing chemical and biological information.  
- Signatures are generated via Siamese neural networks trained with a triplet approach (anchor, positive, negative), allowing bioactively similar molecules to have close representations in vector space.  
- These representations are useful for predicting biological properties, comparing compounds, and analyzing chemical similarity.  

## Workflow in the predictor
1. The molecule is standardized (clean-up, largest fragment, uncharging, tautomerization).  
2. The **GLOBAL signature** of the molecule is generated.  
3. The signature is converted to a tensor and fed into the trained neural network to obtain gene expression predictions.
